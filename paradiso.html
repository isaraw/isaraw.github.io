As I always say, I'm a movie director by mistake, in the sense that I wanted to do something else in my life, like being an hairdresser,” </i>he said. Paradiso, his last documentary, shot in Derry, will be screened today at the Arcipelago Rome Film Festival.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

		                    <p>Alessandro recalls that his grandfather used to run a cinema in a small town in Italy, which turned into a ball room every Saturday night. <i>“Perhaps it was in my genes that sooner or later I would have become a director...or a ticket collector. But I realized that being a director paid more,”</i> he jokes.
		<br>
		<br>He claims to be inspired by a friend of his, the Norwegian director Knut Eric Yensen, and by <b>the movies of Federico Fellini:</b><i> <b>“I worship him though it would be even outrageous to say that he's my reference point.”</b></i><b> </b>However, his mother has been his true guiding star.  When he was a child, she used to bring him to the ball rooms: <i>“Paradiso is also a tribute to a world that is vanishing, the world of the ball rooms, where I grew up,” he says. “My mother thought me to never get old, which doesn't mean not having wrinkles, but not being disenchanted.”
		<br></i>
		<br>“When I grew up I was convinced that I wanted to be a poet.” He also went to live in Paris to write poems for two years.&nbsp;<br></p>

		                    <p>Then he read a quote by Benedetto Croce:<i> “Until the age of 18 everybody writes poems. From 18 years on two categories remain: the poets and the idiots”. “I've always been afraid to belong to the second one, so I stopped,”</i> he jokes. <i>“But I still write them for myself. Instead of going to the shrink, a notebook costs 99p, the analyst costs 99£, you know... “&nbsp;</i><br><br>After having produced a couple of short movies in Italy, in 2001 he moved to Derry where he shot <b>“The House of Phrases”</b>, with a budget of only £500: <i>“We used a chair with wheels instead of the track.”</i> The film won the  Best Online International Documentary award at the 14th Foyle Film festival in Derry, the Underground Film  Festival in Dublin and the Havana Film Festival in Cuba.
		<br>
		<br>His second short movie shot in Ireland, Lies and Waves, tells the story of the friendship between an old man who's never seen the sea - as his grandfather, he says - and a child who has always told lies.<i> “I've always been fascinated by people who live off-hour, who follow their inner clock,”</i> he says.
		<br><br>Between 2006 and 2009 Alessandro worked on Paradiso. The movie tells the story of  a musician, Roy Arbucke, who decides to reunite his former Showband, The Signetts, and his formers musicians, now in their seventies, organizing a major dance night where Protestants and Catholics could finally dance
		together again in The Fountain, a Protestant ghetto in Derry.<br>

		                    <p><i>“Roy is a poet, a person able to interpret that reality raising its level of interpretation,”</i> he says. <i>“However, I found out that is much easier to bring together Catholics and Protestants than the musicians: generally they are all primadonna’s.”
		</i><br>
		<br>The movie was then selected for the Monterrey International Film Festival in Mexico and won the Slow Film Festival in Hungary. <i>“This gave me confidence.<b> I thought that the film had an international appeal, not that it could win</b>.” </i>Afterwards, the movie won the Best Documentary Award in Bangladesh; the Audience Award  in Germany; the Best Documentary Award in India and was selected in many other international festivals.
		<br>
		<br>At the beginning the problem was to convince someone to finance it. <i>“Nobody gave a damn of this ghetto full of old Protestants,” </i>says Alessandro. <b><i>“When I discovered it at the time, they even used to close the gate with a chain.”</i></b> However, <i>“I was so lucky to have probably one of the best producers around, Margo Harkin, of Besom Productions, which produced Waive Raiders, to name one,”</i> says Alessandro. The movie was eventually financed by the BBC.  The director of photography, Odd Geir Saeter, worked in Inland Empire, David Lynch's last movie.

		                    <p><b>The gamble of the movie was that neither Alessandro nor Margo knew the outcome of the ball night.</b> Until the eve of the ball there were 40 tickets sold out of 300 and it looked like the night was going to be a flop. <i>“If it was so I would have shot the disappointment of a dream that never came true. On the contrary there were 300 people,</i>” he commented.
		<br>
		<br>A movie about Derry means a movie about the troubles, by definition. But Alessandro didn't want a movie about the troubles:<i> “I was fed up with them as many other people are. The troubles are there but it's not a movie about the troubles. They are the expedient to talk about  a culture where people live in fear of each other and with the need of an enemy. The enemy gives them an identity.”
		</i><br>
		<br><b>Alessandro has an insight of the city which gave the movie a sort of universal and critical touch</b>, as he observes: <i>“The movie is not much about Derry but rather about a reality that could be translated in Mexico as in any other place in the world. I think that Derry owns the appeal of places that have just abandoned  a conflict, but it is spoiling this energy. It could really revive, instead it is simply recreating the old. It's like if it was in love with its own chains.”</i></p>
