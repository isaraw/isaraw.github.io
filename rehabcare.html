		                        <p class="lead">A garden consisting of tunnels, pathways, grassy mounds, hidden spaces, and tall coloured poles dotted. This is not the latest Disney amusement park, but a project currently undertaken by RehabCare's Childern's Respite Service in Navan. The centre is a residential respite service for children within the Meath area with disabilities and or on the Autism Spectrum.&nbsp;<br></p>
		                        <p>"Our goal with the creative garden was to provide the children using the service with a space that they could use safely and independently" Louise Tinne, Residential Services Manager explained to Rehabbingo. "We wanted a space that would encourage the children to explore and enjoy without relying on staff."
		<br>Tinne explained that the garden is an exploratory play garden. It has been designed specifically with the input of an occupational therapist to address the diverse range of needs of the service user group and with the aim of encouraging children to become independent in the area of outdoor play. "We are not aware of any other such project and are really looking forward to it, to see the reaction of the children when they see it for the first time will be worth the hard work and the wait," said Louise Tinne.
		<br>Officially opened in 2011 by RTÉ's Miriam O'Callaghan, the centre, providing respite services for about 70 children, offers mainly residential respite but there is a specific transitioning programme for each individual child so many may remain on afternoon visits for a month, others a year.

		                        <blockquote>
		                            One of the main functions of the service is to be actively involved in the community with the children. "We attend local playgrounds, beaches, shopping centres, the cinema and other community facilities as each child enjoys. Within the service we have a snozeleen room and we are currently awaiting the commencement of our exploratory play garden," said Louise Tinne. 
		                        </blockquote>
		                        <p>The staff also focus on the daily aspects of life such as completing homework, healthy diets, personal care routines and all areas of improving each individuals independence. There is also plenty of time for arts and crafts, cookery, board games and TV within the house.
		<br>"Every child has their own support plan," Tinne continued. "This highlights the areas of support required and we will endeavour to help improve their independence in these areas. As children are only in with us two nights a month we do what we can in that short space of time. There are many areas where we have supported change. Many children sleep on their own where previously they would not have done so without the presence of their parent throughout the night. Others have improved socially, interacting with peers. Some have improved their diets by watching their peers try new things and follow suit."
		<br>The garden, the fundraising of which has recently been completed, features elements for all the senses but they are subtle as with the variety of children attending "we had to be conscious of the effects of many items." "There has been a lot of work put into to fundraising by all the staff and families and we would not have reached the target without the support of the local community and the rehab Foundation local fundraiser Mary Gamble," Tinne added.</p>

For years now, the capital that gave birth to some of the 20th century’s most revolutionary artists has been lagging behind other leading European cities in terms of contemporary art. It’s finally time to get back on tracks.

We asked him few questions about his unusual work and his opinion about Dublin street art.
